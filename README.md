# EC-Admin

EC-Admin is a collection of advanced management, optimization, and customization
tools for CloudBees Flow. It includes tools for:

* Bulk resource health checks
* White labeling
* Log management
* Advanced backup
* License statistics
* Debug tools
* More

EC-Admin is used in many CloudBees Flow field deployments.

In June 2018, the plugin was converted to the [Plugin Wizard DSL framework](https://github.com/electric-cloud/PluginWizard)
format so the whole plugin code is now managed on GitHub without the need
to extract the project first. In March 2019, the plugin was furthermore
converted to the new [plugin builder](https://github.com/electric-cloud/ec-plugin-tool)
to improve promotion time

The official stable version can be found in the plugins catalog or in
our [plugins directory](https://electric-cloud.com/plugins/directory/p/ec-admin).
You can also follow development in our [Community GitHub repository](https://github.com/electric-cloud-community/EC-Admin).
For the latest code changes, check the [maintainer's fork](https://github.com/lrochette/EC-Admin)

Requirements:

* CloudBees Flow 6.0 minimum
* EC-PluginManager 1.4.0


## Installation

It is available as a plugin delivered in the form of a .jar file.

To install the plugin, use one the following methods:

* CloudBees Flow Administration/Plugins UI - "Install from File/URL"
* CLI - `ectool installPlugin --force 1 EC-Admin.jar`

Don't forget to promote the plugin after installation.

To install on 4.0.x or or 4.1.x, import the EC_4.0.xml file. Be

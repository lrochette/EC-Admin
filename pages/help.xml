  <p>EC-Admin is a collection of administrative procedures to help you
manage your server. Its inception was sparked by requests from customers
during my Professional Services engagements. It has grown over the years to
what it is now.</p>

  <h2><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h2>

  <p>This collection of procedures can be found in the catalog or in our
  <a href="https://electric-cloud.com/plugins/directory/p/ec-admin">Plugins
    directory</a> for the official stable version. You can also follow development
    in our <a href="https://github.com/electric-cloud-community/EC-Admin">Community
    GitHub repository</a>. It is available as a plugin delivered in the form of
    a .jar file. It requires ElectricFlow 6.0 at a minimum.</p>

  <p>To install the plugin, use one the following methods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the "Install from File/URL" tab in the administration/Plugins</li>
    <li>the Perl "$ec->installPlugin()" API.</li>
    <li> the CLI client "ectool installPlugin --force 1 EC-Admin.jar</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Don't forget to promote the plugin after installation.</p>

  <p>To install on 4.0.x or or 4.1.x, import the EC_4.0.xml file. Be
  aware that some features are not present as the original project
  makes use of createJobStep() API which was introduced in 4.2.0:<br/>
ectool import /path_to/EC-Admin_for_EC_4.0.xml --disableSchedules 1</p>

	<h2>jobCleanup_byResult:</h2>
  <p>A procedure to delete jobs older than a specified number of days.
It will also delete associated workspace job directories. It will keep the
number of successful, failed, and warning jobs you entered. You can also
provide a property name; if this property is attached to the job, it won't be
deleted no matter how old. A report only mode prevents any real deletion.</p>

  <h2>deleteWorkspaceOrphans:</h2>

  <p>A procedure to crawl a workspace directory to find orphan jobs
(directories without a matching job) on a specified resource.</p>

	<h2>deleteObjects:</h2>
  <p>A procedure to quickly delete jobs or workflows older than a
specified number of days. It will <b>not</b> delete associated workspace job
directories. This is for customers with a huge database.</p>


	<h1><a name="plugin"></a>Plugins</h1>
	<h2>Plugin Synchronization</h2>
	<p>This procedure synchronizes plugins between the server and
	a resource. Plugins are uploaded first as artifacts if it has not been
	done already and then downloaded on the resource if they do not
	already exist in the plugins directory.</p>

	<h1><a name="artifacts"></a>Artifact Management</h1>

	<h2>artifactRepositorySynchronization</h2>

	<p>Synchronize the content of a source artifact repository to a target
	one. You can use pattern matching to select specific artifact
	versions to synchronize.</p>

  <h2>artifactsCleanup</h2>

	<p>A procedure to delete artifact versions older than a specified number
of days. Same as for jobs above, a property can prevent the deletion. Once the
artifacts have been deleted, artifact repositories and artifact caches are
cleaned as well (deleting stale artifacts). A report mode prevents any
real deletion.</p>

	<h2>artifactsCleanup_byQuantity</h2>

	<p>As "ArtifactsCleanup"", this procedure deletes artifact versions older than a
    specified number of days but keeps only X per Artifact. Again, a property
    allows preventing the deletion. Once the artifacts have been deleted, artifact
    repositories and artifact caches are cleaned as well (deleting stale artifacts).
    A report only mode prevents any real deletion.</p>

	<h1><a name="backup"></a>Object export and backup</h1>
  <p>This set of procedures is to help you export objects from
ElectricCommander for a potential inclusion into your SCM for
versioning.</p>

	<h2>saveProjects</h2>
  <p>This procedure has been obsoleted. It now simply calls "saveAllObjects". It
    is still around for backward compatibility only.</p>

	<h2>saveAllObjects</h2>

  <p>This procedure brings a finer granularity to a full server export.
For  example, it may be easier to retrieve a simple project or procedure
instead of the full server export; or database backup to undo a wrong action
or a bad code change. By  default, it exports projects and each procedure
individually. In addition, by enabling the matching checkboxes, you can also
export steps, ACLs, notifiers, resources and resource pools, workspaces,
users and groups, gateways and zones, workspace definitions, artifacts and
artifact versions (not the content itself);  and  ElectricFlow Deploy objects
(Applications, Components, Environments, services, pipelines, releases, ...).
It is recommended to enable the nightly schedule associated
with it to backup your projects on a regular basis.</p>

	<p><b>Note:</b> Use saveProjects or saveAllObjects depending on the
		granularity you are requiring.</p>

           For example "^B" indicates all objects starting with a "B". The

	<h1><a name="semaphore"></a>Semaphore Management</h1>

	<h2>acquireSemaphore and releaseSemaphore:</h2>

	<p>Those 2 procedures are used to create a "semaphore" to control the access to
    a set of steps. In order to insure the atomicity (only one step can modify
    your sempahore property at any time) of the operation, you first need to create
    a resource with a 1-step limit.<br/>
    Then you will need to create a property with a value of 0. The location
    does not matter
    as long as it will be readable and writable by the plugin.</p>

  <h2>acquireSemaphore</h2>
  <p>This procedure is the "gate". It checks that you have not used more
    tokens than allowed. If you have, it will simly wait until some become

  <h2>findJobId</h2>
  <p>This procedure is designed for people migrating away from ElectricCommander
    4.2 to ElectricFlow 5.x or later. It will simply search in the step commands
    or parameters to a sub-procedure for any instance of jobId. No change will
    be done. It's up to the user to make any change.</p>

				<td>A SQL pattern to filter projects for the search.</td>
